## Hi there 👋 I'm Altaher!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Altaher, a software developer with a deep-rooted passion for **aerospace**, **control systems**, **optimisation**, and **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) algorithms**. This fascination stems from my academic background, having graduated with a **BSc in Aeronautical Engineering**, where I focused my studies and final project on control systems and algorithms.

My professional journey has allowed me to apply these interests in diverse software engineering roles. I have experience in:

*   🚀 Designing and building scalable **backend systems**, including microservices for e-commerce, multi-tenant financial/accounting platforms, and consumer-facing applications.
*   ⚙️ Developing and implementing **optimisation engines**, particularly for real-time matching and route optimisation.
*   📊 Leveraging **data analysis**, BI, and machine learning for forecasting, pattern discovery, performance analysis, and fraud detection.
*   ☁️ Working with **cloud platforms** (AWS & Azure) and implementing **DevOps** practices like CI/CD, automation, and infrastructure management.
*   🛡️ Enhancing system **reliability and security** through performance tuning, bottleneck resolution, vulnerability patching, and DDOS mitigation.
*   🤝 Leading and **mentoring** development teams on best practices in software design, testing, security, and workflows.

### Skills Highlights:

*   **Languages:** Python, C#, TypeScript
*   **Frameworks:** FastAPI, ASP.NET Core, Litestar, NextJS
*   **Data:** SQL, Polars, Pandas, Numpy, Power BI/DAX
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Azure, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, Linux CLI
*   **Concepts:** Control Systems, Optimisation, GNC, State Machines, Microservices, System Design, Data Structures & Algorithms

### Featured Projects:

*   🛰️ `stk-mcp`: An MCP server enabling interaction with Ansys/AGI STK simulation software, bridging the gap between simulation and external control/analysis.
*   🗺️ `python-tercom-demo` & `python-dsmac-demo`: Python demonstrations of classic GPS-denied navigation techniques (Terrain Contour Matching and Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator).
*   ⚙️ `stateless-py`: A versatile Python library for creating finite state machines, inspired by the C# Stateless library.
*   🗺️ `HexPicker`: An interactive web map application for visualizing and selecting H3 hexagonal geospatial cells.
